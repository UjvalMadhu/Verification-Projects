## Libraries and Tools

1. Cocotb
    Cocotb (pronounced "cocoa-TB") stands for Coroutine-based Cosimulation TestBench. It's a powerful, open-source Python library and framework designed for verifying digital hardware designs using cosimulation.

    ### Basic Workflow with Cocotb:
    - Design in HDL (Verilog or VHDL): You have your digital hardware design described in Verilog or VHDL (the Device Under Test - DUT).
    - Write Testbench in Python (using Cocotb): You create a Python testbench file that uses Cocotb to interact with the DUT. This testbench will:
        - Instantiate the DUT in the simulator.
        - Apply stimulus (inputs) to the DUT.
        - Observe the outputs and internal signals of the DUT.
        - Perform checks and assertions to verify correct behavior.
    - Run Cosimulation: You use a compatible HDL simulator to run the simulation. The simulator will:
        - Load and simulate your HDL design.
        - Run the Cocotb Python testbench alongside the HDL simulation.
        - Allow Cocotb Python code to drive inputs and read outputs of the HDL design during simulation time.


2. PyUVM
    PyUVM stands for Python Universal Verification Methodology. It is a Python-based library that aims to bring the most used principles and structure of the widely-adopted Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) IEEE 1800.2 Standard, traditionally used with SystemVerilog, to the Python ecosystem.

    PyUVM is often used alongside Cocotb. Cocotb provides the infrastructure for cosimulation (interfacing Python with HDL simulators), while PyUVM provides a higher-level, structured methodology for building the verification environment on top of Cocotb.

3. Icarus Verilog
    Icarus Verilog (often shortened to Icarus) is a popular, open-source, command-line based Verilog simulator. It's a crucial tool in the world of digital hardware design and verification, especially within open-source and educational settings.
    - Compiles your Verilog code to create an internal representation of your design.
    - Simulates the design using an event-driven engine, processing events (signal changes) in time order.
    - Propagates value changes through the circuit's interconnections.
    - Executes procedural blocks and system tasks.
    - Allows external tools like Cocotb to interact with the simulation through interfaces, enabling powerful verification capabilities.

4. GTKWave
    GTKWave is a powerful waveform viewer used extensively in digital design and electronic design automation (EDA). It's primarily used to visualize signal waveforms generated during simulations of digital circuits and systems described in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL.

    - Waveform Viewer: GTKWave's primary purpose is to display and analyze signal waveforms. These waveforms represent how signal values (logic levels, analog voltages, etc.) change over time during a simulation.
    - Post-Simulation Analysis Tool: GTKWave is a post-simulation tool. This means it doesn't perform the simulation itself. Instead, it reads waveform data that has been generated by an HDL simulator (like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado Simulator, etc.) after a simulation run is complete.
    - Open Source and Free: GTKWave is open-source software, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This makes it freely available to use and distribute, a significant advantage for many users, especially in open-source and educational environments.
    - Cross-Platform: GTKWave is designed to be cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This portability is essential for users working on different development platforms.
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI): GTKWave has a graphical user interface, allowing users to interact with waveforms visually.
